# Improving the Focus of Automatically Generated Unit Tests with Slicing and Coverage Entropy

The content of this replication package is the following.
We provide:

* [here](https://github.com/blindsubmissions/icse19replication/tree/master/generated-tests) the test suites generated with our prototype tool used for the conducted studies;
* [here](https://github.com/blindsubmissions/icse19replication/tree/master/raw-data) the raw data and the scripts used to shape our results and findings;
* [here](https://github.com/blindsubmissions/icse19replication/tree/master/scripts-generation) the scripts we used to generate the tests;
* [here](https://github.com/blindsubmissions/icse19replication/tree/master/source) the complete source code of our implementation. Please note that the project cannot be built since we do not share the APIs we received from the authors of _Automatic Test Case Generation: What if Test Code Quality Matters?_. However, the jar itself can be downloaded at [link](https://mega.nz/#!UdhzRJrK!_8UuEo04Iohn9d2qP9F1s8Zy_bulhrpOSNoiZAYs3yY) link.  
* [rq0](https://github.com/blindsubmissions/icse19replication/tree/master/rq0) contains the tests we manually labeled, as well the outcome of such manual labeling.

**NOTE**: in this replication package, we refer to _TERMite_ with the _rmosa_ name.
